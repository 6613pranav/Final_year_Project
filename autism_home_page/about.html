									<h4 class="blog-title">What is Autism ?</h4>
									<div class="post-meta">
										
									</div>
									<p>
										Autism is a lifelong neurological condition, a developmental disorder that typically occurs in the first three 
										years of life. Autism appears as differences in development in three main areas: communication (verbal and 
										non-verbal), social interactions and imagination, which can be seen in repetitive and restricted play or 
										leisure activities. This is referred to as the triad of impairments.<br><br>
										While these areas are often late to develop, what is more significant is that they develop in unusual 
										ways. Many individuals with autism have different ways of ‘sensing’ their world. For example, some may not 
										like being touched gently but prefer a firm hold. Others may have difficulty in brushing their teeth or having a 
										haircut. Many will have difficulty in tolerating some everyday sounds. Or some may have extreme likes and 
										dislikes in their diet. Given these differences in communication, social interaction, imagination, in ‘sensing’
										their world, many people with autism may have very unusual behaviours and atypical ways of relating to 
										people, objects and events in the environment. As a result they are often mistakenly thought to be 
										‘disobedient’ or ‘badly behaved’.<br><br>
										Autism is known as a ‘spectrum disorder’ because the severity of symptoms can range from a mild learning 
										and social disability, to more complex needs with multiple difficulties and often very unusual behaviour.
										Autism results in qualitative impairments. This means that in a person with autism, skills are present (not absent) 
										but do not develop age appropriately. Therefore different skills develop at a different pace in different people with autism.<br><br>
										They have a certain common set of social, communication and sensory issues that affect their behaviour in predictable ways. 
										Their language skills may range from those who do not speak to those who display complex, grammatically correct speech. 
										Some individuals may show only slight delays in language and greater difficulties in making friends.
										Some may have no sensory difficulties while for others every day contains too much sensory information<br><br>
									</p>
									<h4 class="blog-title">How common is Autism?</h4>
									<p>Autism is not a rare or uncommon disorder. It is the third most common developmental disorder, 
										more common than Down’s syndrome. With an increase in understanding and awareness levels,
										professionals are beginning to understand that some people who were diagnosed 
										with mental retardation, hyperactivity, or labelled badly behaved children may actually have autism.<br><br>
										Recent international studies show that about 1 in 68 people have autism and the overall incidence of autism is
										believed to be consistent around the globe (CDC, 2014). This means that there are over 18 million people with 
										autism in India. This also means that we have all come across at least one person with autism in our lives.
									</p>
									<h4 class="blog-title">Signs and Symtoms</h4>
									<p>Parents or doctors may first identify ASD behaviors in infants and toddlers. School staff may recognize these
										behaviors in older children. Not all people with ASD will show all of these behaviors, but most will show several.
										There are two main types of behaviors: “restricted / repetitive behaviors” and “social communication / interaction behaviors.”
										</p>
									<h4 class="blog-title">Treatments and Therapies</h4>
									<p>Early treatment for ASD and proper care can reduce individuals’ difficulties while helping them learn new 
										skills and make the most of their strengths. The very wide range of issues facing those “on the spectrum”
										means that there is no single best treatment for ASD. Working closely with a doctor or health care professional is an 
										important part of finding the right treatment program. 
										There are many treatment options, social services, programs, and other resources that can help.</p>

						<h4 class="widget-title">Autism Facts</h4>
						<p>1. Autism spectrum disorder now affects 1 in 68 children. Boys are nearly 5 times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with ASD.</p>
						<p>2. Autism spectrum disorder is one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the United States. ASD is more common than childhood cancer, diabetes and AIDS combined.</p>
						<p>3. Autism spectrum disorder affects all nationalities, all creeds, all religions, all races and both sexes. It doesn’t differentiate or affect only one group or another.</p>
						<p>4. Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disability that generally appears before the age of 3.</p>
						<p>5. The earlier autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed and treated, the better. Outcomes for children's lives are significantly improved with early diagnosis and treatment.</p>
						<p>6. Parents do not and cannot cause autism spectrum disorder. Although the multiple causes of ASD are not known, it is known that parental behavior before, during and after pregnancy does not cause ASD.</p>
						<p>7. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder have communication deficits. It is important to distinguish between spoken language and social communication deficits.</p>
						<p>8. Children and adults with autism spectrum disorder often care deeply but lack the ability to spontaneously develop empathic and socially connected typical behavior. Individuals with ASD often want to socially interact but lack the ability to spontaneously develop effective social interaction skills.</p>
						<p>9. If one identical twin has autism spectrum disorder, there is a 60-96% chance the other twin will have some form of ASD. Although fraternal twins have a lower chance of both having ASD, if one has an ASD the other has up to a 24% chance.</p>
						<p>10. About 10% of children with autism spectrum disorder also have another genetic, neurological, or metabolic disorder.</p>
